## Quick Data Summary Shiny Application  

As a first exploratory analysis we routinely check its dimension, classes, statistics, missing values, correlations and so on. 
There are packages that enable us to see the summaries at once or display a matrix of graphs, but sometimes it's difficult to find 
information we need at a glance. By using this app, you can explore your data in one page, graph the data with different variables 
without executing the same code multiple times.
